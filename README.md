You have been tasked with designing a better water delivery component (WDC) for a small hydro-electric generator, Figure 1. The turbine and

alternator exist and you will adapt your design to suit. The new WDC will be 3D Printed and tested in term 3. There will be a prize for the best performing generator.

Because the generator is a bought component there are no drawings available so you must make a complete solid model of the existing parts and your WDC. Several items as shown in Figure 1 will be made available for measuring in Machines laboratory in ECE.

<em>Figure 1 Hydro-electric generator </em>

Your tasks:

Make solid models of the supplied parts. Add screws but do not model the screw threads. Also, don’t model the generator windings and make an approximate representation of the electronics board, don’t show the three small red wires. Make a representation of the two wires exiting the body and taking a 90 degree bend at 50mm from the body on the plane of the bolted clamping surface as represented in Figure 2.

Design a new water delivery component that will direct the water flow onto the turbine giving the best performance measured by electric output. A “garden hose tail” for garden hose must be included for connecting to the water supply and drain. The drain hose will be 300mm long and can exit in any orientation. The supply hose can also enter at any chosen angle.

The system must be sealed so that there is no water leakage when operating.

To cope with extra power from the generator a taller, by 10mm, electronics board cover plate must be designed. This part will be injection moulded in production so a full manufacturing drawing is required.




<em>Figure 2 Approximate wire orientation </em>You are required to produce:

<ul>

 <li>A colour layout drawing with a single, angled for best presentation, view of the complete assembly. Annotate any special features/specifications.</li>

 <li>An exploded view with a BOM. Identify in the BOM whether parts are bought standard parts eg. bolts, or the manufacturing process to used and the material to be used.</li>

 <li>A dimensioned manufacturing drawing of the electronics cover that is 10mm longer than the supplied one. This must include at least one section view and a shaded isometric view in the top right corner.</li>

 <li>A STL faceted model file for 3D printing the prototype WDC.</li>

 <li>and aesthetics of your design. Upload this file to a folder to be advised. The file name must be your  student code eg. GKT304.stl. Failure to do this will result in zero for this section.</li>
